#### Task

*   [Directions](#directions)
*   [Submission History](#step_submission_history)

 Estimated Task Time: 1 - 3 hours.

In this Task, you’ll include additional content in your about and contact pages and make your portfolio site project accessible. Remember—to preview your site, just double-click your HTML file from the Finder window or from your file explorer to open it directly in your default browser.

**Directions**

1.  Add a form to your contact page:
    
    *   Add a contact form to your “contact.html” page (you can also reuse the one from the bonus task in your CodePen).
    *   Validation: Make sure your form includes HTML5 form validation.
    *   Accessibility: Make sure your form includes labels for each input field.
2.  Add content to your about page:
    
    *   Add some information about yourself to the about page.
    *   Add a table to your about page (e.g., regarding your skills, years of experience, etc.).
    *   Accessibility: Make sure the content is structured semantically.
    *   Accessibility: Make sure the data tables are using all necessary tags (e.g., thead, tbody, etc.).
3.  Make your portfolio site project accessible:
    
    *   Add the accessibility checker “[tota11y](http://khan.github.io/tota11y/)” to your site and try to remove all errors. To do so, follow the steps provided earlier in the Exercise to create a new “tota11y.min.js” file and link to it in your HTML files.
    *   Add alt text to all of your images.
    *   Add `role` attributes to your navigation.
    *   Make sure you use all semantic HTML tags (e.g., `<footer>`, `<header>`, `<nav>`, etc.).
4.  Once you’re happy with your code, save it and create a zip file of all the folders within your website’s structure.
    
5.  Upload your zip file here. Feel free to share additional thoughts or ask questions on your submission page.
